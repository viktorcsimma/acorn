-- From CoRN (reals/faster/ARAlternatingSum.v):
{-
The goal of this section is to compute the infinite alternating sum. Since
we do not have a precise division operation, we want to postpone divisions as
long as possible. Hence we parametrize our infinite sum by a stream [sN]
of numerators and a stream [sD] of denominators.

To compute an infinite series at precision epsilon, the finite number n of
terms to sum can be computed exactly, because sN n / sD n < epsilon/2 is
equivalent to sN n < (sD n) * epsilon/2, which does not involve the approximate
division. In the other epsilon/2, we can approximate the n divisions at
precision 2^k such as n*2^k < epsilon/2.
